## üîß Maintenance Queries

### Data Cleanup (Remove Old Events)

DELETE FROM error_logs 
WHERE timestamp < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

### Database Performance
```sql
-- Check table sizes
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  attname,
  n_distinct,
  correlation

## üìù Usage Notes

1. **Time Ranges**: Adjust the `INTERVAL` values based on your analysis needs
2. **Performance**: Add indexes for frequently queried columns
3. **Data Retention**: Implement regular cleanup of old data
4. **Privacy**: Ensure compliance with data protection regulations
5. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for unusual error patterns

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Set up automated dashboards using these queries
2. Create alerts for critical error patterns
3. Implement A/B testing event tracking
4. Add user feedback and satisfaction metrics
5. Create custom reports for business stakeholders
